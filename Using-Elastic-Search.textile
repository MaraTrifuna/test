bq. Elasticsearch is a flexible and powerful open source, distributed real-time search and analytics engine for the cloud. Elasticsearch allows you to start small, but will grow with your business. It is built to scale horizontally out of the box. As you need more capacity, just add more nodes, and let the cluster reorganize itself to take advantage of the extra hardware. Elasticsearch clusters are resilient â€“ they will detect and remove failed nodes, and reorganize themselves to ensure that your data is safe and accessible. --  "Elasticsearch Homepage":http://elasticsearch.org/

Titan supports "Elasticsearch":http://elasticsearch.org as an embedded or remote index backend. In embedded mode, Elasticsearch runs in the same JVM as Titan and stores data on the local machine. In remote mode, Titan connects to a running Elasticsearch cluster as a client. If not in embedded mode, be sure to have the Elasticsearch running and accessible.

h2. Feature Support

h3. Full-Text

Supports the @Text.CONTAINS@ condition to search for text properties that contain a given word.

h3. Geo

Supports the @Geo.WITHIN@ condition to search for points that fall within a given circle. Only supports points for indexing and circles for querying.

h3. Numeric Range

Supports all numeric comparisons in @Compare@.

h2. Configuration Options

This is the full list of configuration options for Elasticsearch. Note, that each of these options needs to be prefixed with @storage.index.[INDEX-NAME].@ where @[INDEX-NAME]@ stands for the name of the index backend. For instance, if the index backend is named _search_ then these configuration options need to be prefixed with @storage.index.search.@

|_. Option |_. Description |_. Value |_. Default |_. Modifiable |
| backend | Index backend implementation name | _elasticsearch_ | - | - |
| hostname | Comma-separated list of IP addresses or hostnames of the instances in the Elasticsearch cluster | IPs | - | yes |
| index-name | Name of the index | string | titan | no |
| cluster-name | Name of the Elasticsearch cluster. If none is defined, the name will be ignored. | string | elasticsearch | yes |
| local-mode | Whether Titan should run Elasticsearch embedded | boolean | _false_ | no |
| directory | Directory to store Elasticsearch data in. _Only applicable when running Elasticsearch embedded_ | string | - | yes |
| config-file | Filename of the Elasticsearch yaml file used to configure this instance. _Only applicable when running Elasticsearch embedded_ | boolean | _false_ | no |
| client-only | Whether this node is a client node with no data | boolean | _true_ | no |

h2. Configuration File

Note that each backend distribution has a @bin/*-es.local@ file that provides out of the box local configuration for Elasticsearch. For example, @bin/cassandra-es.local@.
