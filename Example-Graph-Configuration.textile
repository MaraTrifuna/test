This page illustrates a number of common graph configurations. Please refer to the [[Graph Configuration]] documentation and the pages of the respective [[storage backend|Storage Backend Overview]] and [[index backend|Indexing Backend Overview]] for more information.

h3. BerkeleyDB

```properties
storage.backend=berkeleyje
storage.directory=/tmp/graph

storage.index.search.backend=elasticsearch
storage.index.search.directory=/tmp/searchindex
storage.index.search.client-only=false
storage.index.search.local-mode=true
```

This configuration file configures Titan to use [[BerkeleyDB|Using BerkeleyDB]] as an embedded storage backend, meaning, Titan will start BerkeleyDB internally. The primary data will be stored in the directory @/tmp/graph@.

In addition, this configures an embedded [[Elasticsearch|Using Elastic Search]] index backend with the name @search@. Titan will start Elasticsearch internally and it will not be externally accessible since @local-mode@ is enabled. Elasticsearch stores all data for the @search@ index in @/tmp/searchindex@. Configuring an index backend is optional.

h3. Cassandra

h4. Cassandra Remote

```properties
storage.backend=cassandra
storage.hostname=100.100.100.1,100.100.100.2

storage.index.search.backend=elasticsearch
storage.index.search.hostname=100.100.101.1,100.100.101.2
storage.index.search.client-only=true
```

This configuration file configures Titan to use [[Cassandra|Using Cassandra]] as a remote storage backend. It assumes that a Cassandra cluster is running and accessible at the given IP addresses. If Cassandra is running locally, use the IP address @127.0.0.1@.

In addition, this configures a remote [[Elasticsearch|Using Elastic Search]] index backend with the name @search@. It assumes that an Elasticsearch cluster is running and accessible at the given IP addresses. Enabling @client-only@ ensures that the local instance does not join the existing Elasticsearch cluster as another node but only connects to it. Configuring an index backend is optional.

h4. Embedded Cassandra

```properties
storage.backend=embeddedcassandra
storage.cassandra-config-dir=config/cassandra.yaml

storage.index.search.backend=elasticsearch
storage.index.search.directory=/tmp/searchindex
storage.index.search.client-only=false
storage.index.search.local-mode=true
```

This configuration file configures Titan to start [[Cassandra|Using Cassandra]] internally embedded in Titan and specifies the yaml configuration file for Cassandra. Cassandra is still accessible externally and can connect to other available Cassandra nodes to form a cluster as configured in the yaml file.

The optional index backend configuration is identical to the one described above.
