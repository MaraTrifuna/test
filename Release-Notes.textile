*Tested Compatibility:*

* TinkerPop (Blueprints, Gremlin, Rexster) 2.2.0

* This version is incompatible with the previous version of Titan. Please follow the [[Upgrade Instructions]] to switch to the new version. *

*Features:*

* Embedded Cassandra: Titan can be embedded with Cassandra, that means, Titan starts a Cassandra node in the same JVM and uses efficient in process communication to store and retrieve data.
* [[Titan Server]]: Titan comes with a light-weight Gremlin query server.
* Streamlined configuration settings. Please review the new configuration options if you are upgrading from an older version of Titan.
* Many small performance improvements throughout the code. Please review the issue tracker and the commit log for more details.

*Bugfixes:*

* Fixed edge sorting bug which caused edges to be returned in a random order even when a vertex centric index was defined.
* Fixed id allocation bug that causes Titan to read the entire row during id allocation which can lead to id allocation failures.
* Completely refactored diskstorage package for better code quality and performance.
* Fixed edge caching bug for composite primary keys on edges.
* Fixed a number of smaller bugs. Please review the issue tracker and the commit log for more details.
