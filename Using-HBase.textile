HBase is a BigTable implementation built on Hadoop and HDFS.

Titan can store graph data in HBase as an alternative to [[Cassandra|Using Cassandra]].

h2. Testing Titan's HBase Adapter (for Developers)

Titan's HBase backend tests currently assume the existence of a running, locally-available HBase instance with an essentially default configuration.  These tests will fail otherwise.  Here are the steps to start a testing HBase instance on a development machine and run the relevant tests.

The assumption of an externally-started HBase instance will likely be removed as development on the Titan HBase adapter continues.

* Download and extract a stable HBase from [[http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hbase/stable/]].
* Start HBase.  In 0.92.1, the stable version as of this writing, the startup command on OS X or Linux is @hbase-0.92.1/bin/start-hbase.sh@.
* Clone Titan.
<pre>git@github.com:thinkaurelius/titan.git
cd titan</pre>
* Run the HBase tests.  On a machine with the @mvn@ command-line Maven client installed,
<pre>mvn clean test -Dtest=HBaseKeyColumnValueTest
mvn clean test -Dtest=HBaseGraphDBTest</pre>
