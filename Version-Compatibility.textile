The Titan project is growing along with the rest of the Aurelius Graph Cluster technology and utilized storage and indexing backends. Below are version compatibilities between the various versions of components.

| *Titan* | *Faunus* | *Cassandra* | *HBase* | *ElasticSearch* |
| 0.1-alpha | N/A | 1.1.z | 0.92.z | N/A |
| 0.1.0| 0.1-alpha | 1.1.z | 0.94.z | N/A |
| 0.2.0 | 0.1.0 | 1.1.z | 0.94.z | N/A |
| 0.2.1 | 0.1.1 | 1.2.z | 0.94.z | N/A |
| 0.3.0 | 0.1.1 | 1.2.z | 0.94.z | 0.20.5 |

*NOTE*: Faunus 0.1.1 does not support the new geo property values in Titan 0.3.0. Faunus simply ignores them as if they don't exist.
