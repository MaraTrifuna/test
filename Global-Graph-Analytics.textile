Titan is designed to compute numerous, concurrent, short-lived, local graph traversals. Titan is _not_ designed for global graph analysis. In order to understand the different, a itemization of each term above is defined below.

  * *Numerous concurrent interactions*: the underlying graph structure is being queried, in parallel, by different users solving different problems.
  * *Short-lived transactions*: each interaction with Titan is intended to be real-time on the order of hundreds of milliseconds.
  * *Local graph traversals*: each transaction is touching a small fraction of the entire graph and as such is solving a problem within a localized region of the graph. 

h2. Faunus: Graph Analytics Engine

Titan is a multi-client database in the classic sense. For performing global graph analytics, Titan relies on "Faunus":http://thinkaurelius.github.com/faunus/. Faunus is a batch processing framework that is optimized for computing a small number of concurrent, long running, global graph traversals. Please review Faunus documentation for instructions on how to connect "Titan to Faunus":https://github.com/thinkaurelius/faunus/wiki/Titan-Format.
