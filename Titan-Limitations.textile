Some of these pitfalls are necessary design choices and others are issues that will be rectified as Titan development continues.

h2. Key Index Must Be Created Prior to Key Being Used

Before a key is used as a vertex property, a key index must be created for it if indexing is desired. This pitfall will be fixed in a future release.

h2. Unable to Drop Key Indices

Once an index has been created for a key, it can never be removed. This pitfall will be fixed in a future release.

h2. Types Can Not Be Changed Once Created

This pitfall constrains the graph schema. While the graph schema can be extended, previous declarations can not be changed. This pitfall will be fixed in a future release.
