Some of these limitations are necessary design choices and others are issues that will be rectified as Titan development continues.

h2. Temporary Limitations

h3. Key Index Must Be Created Prior to Key Being Used

Before a key is used as a vertex property, a key index must be created for it if indexing is desired. This pitfall will be fixed in a future release.

h3. Unable to Drop Key Indices

Once an index has been created for a key, it can never be removed. This pitfall will be fixed in a future release.

h3. Types Can Not Be Changed Once Created

This pitfall constrains the graph schema. While the graph schema can be extended, previous declarations can not be changed. This pitfall will be fixed in a future release.

h3. Batch Loading Speed

Titan provides a batch loading mode that can be enabled through the "configuration":Graph-Configuration. However, this batch mode only facilitates faster loading into the storage backend, it does not use storage backend specific batch loading techniques that prepare the data in memory for disk storage. As such, batch loading in Titan is currently slower than batch loading modes provided by single machine databases.
