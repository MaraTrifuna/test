[[https://raw.github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/master/doc/images/vertex-centric-index.png|align=left|float]] Vertex-centric are indices that are specific to a particular vertex, not to the graph as a whole. The purpose of these indices is to sort and index the incident edges (and thus, adjacent vertices) of a vertex according to the edge labels and properties. By configuring a "vertex query":https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/Vertex-Query, these indices are queried and, in doing so, remove the need for linear scans of edge sets.

h2. Explanation via Real-World Example

created 4 vertices each with 1k, 10k, 100k, and 1 million incident edges. Each edge has a Long.class timestamp property on it.

Next, I query for the top 10 more recent adjacent vertices by edge timestamp. If I don't have vertex centric indices, the query time grows by an order of magnitude to an order of magnitude increase in data size -- nearly perfect relationship. With vertex-centric indices, runtimes are unaffected by the growth of the data size.
