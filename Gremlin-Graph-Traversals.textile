"Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com is a graph traversal language that works for an "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com enabled graph engine. Gremlin is a functional language whereby traversal operators are chained together. Data (e.g. a vertex) is put into the "left" of the function chain and data (e.g. property values) are emitted from the "right" of the function chain. The example below returns the name of all the people that have battled the same monsters as hercules who themselves are not hercules.

```text
hercules.out('battled').in('battled').except([hercules]).name
```

The example above has 4 chained functions: @out@, @in@, @except@, and @property@ (i.e. @name@ is shorthand for @property('name')@). The function signatures of each are itemized below, where @V@ is vertex and @U@ is any object. 
  # @out: V -> V@
  # @in: V -> V@
  # @except: U -> U@
  # @property: V -> U@
