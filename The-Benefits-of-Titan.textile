Titan was designed to support the processing of massive-scale graphs that can not fit within the storage and computational capacities of a single machine. Beyond this foundational feature, the following list itemizes various other Titan benefits. Note that many of these benefits are a ramification of the underlying storage layer.

h2. General Titan Benefits

* Supports graphs of "infinite" size via the addition of more machines to the cluster.
* Native support for the popular property graph data model exposed by Blueprints.
* Numerous graph-level configurations provide knobs for tuning performance within a clustered environment.
* Micro-indices facilitate intelligent vertex-level querying and avoids the infamous super node problem.
* Provides an extremely optimized disk representation to allow for efficient use of storage and speed of access.

h2. Benefits of Titan over Cassandra

* Continuously available with no single point of failure when using Cassandra.
* No read/write bottlenecks to the graph as there is no master/slave architecture when using Cassandra.
* Elastic scalability allows for the introduction and removal of machines when using Cassandra.
