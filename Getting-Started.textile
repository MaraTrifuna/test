In the beginning, there existed two deities known as Uranus and Gaia. They gave birth to Saturn, god of time, who set reality in motion. Ultimately, time yielded the existence of the sky, the sea, and the end of life---death. To rule these notions, Saturn had three sons: Jupiter (sky), Neptune (sea), and Pluto (death).
