In the beginning, there existed two deities known as "Uranus":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(mythology) and "Gaia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(mythology). They gave birth to the "Titans":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(mythology) (a race of powerful beings).  "Saturn":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology), Titan of time, set reality in motion. Ultimately, time yielded the existence of the sky, the sea, and the end of life--death. To rule these notions, Saturn had three sons: "Jupiter":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology) (sky), "Neptune":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_(mythology) (sea), and "Pluto":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_(mythology) (underworld). The son's of Saturn were not Titans, but a race of seemingly less powerful deities known the world over as Gods. Fearful that his sons would overthrow him, Saturn devoured them and imprisoned them in his stomach. This caused a great war between the Titans and Gods. Ultimately, the Gods won and Jupiter took his thrown as leader of the Gods. 

Unbeknownst to the Gods, there still lived one Titan. This Titan can not be seen, has no name, and is only apparent in the fact that reality exists. Upon the shoulders of this lost Titan, all of reality hangs together in a web of relations.
