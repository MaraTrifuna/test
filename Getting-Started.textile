bq. In the beginning, there existed two deities known as "Uranus":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(mythology) and "Gaia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(mythology). They gave birth to the "Titans":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(mythology) (a race of powerful beings).  "Saturn":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology), Titan of time, set reality in motion. Ultimately, time yielded the existence of the sky, the sea, and the end of life--death. To rule these notions, Saturn had three sons: "Jupiter":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology) (sky), "Neptune":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_(mythology) (sea), and "Pluto":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto_(mythology) (underworld). The son's of Saturn were not Titans, but a race of seemingly less powerful deities known the world over as the Gods. Fearful that his sons would overthrow him, Saturn devoured them and imprisoned them in his stomach. This caused a "great war":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanomachy between the Titans and Gods. Ultimately, the Gods won and Jupiter took the thrown as leader of the Gods.

This page will make use of the following toy graph deployed with Titan. The toy graph is called _The Graph of the Gods_ and it provides a collection of heterogenous vertices and edges that outline the relationships between the beings and places within the Roman pantheon and its ancient saga.

h2. Installing Titan

Titan can be installed by downloading a distribution from the "Downloads":https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan/downloads section.

```bash
$ unzip titan-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
Archive:  titan-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip
   creating: titan-0.1-SNAPSHOT/
  inflating: titan-0.1-SNAPSHOT/pom.xml  
   creating: titan-0.1-SNAPSHOT/src/
   creating: titan-0.1-SNAPSHOT/src/assembly/
...
$ cd titan-0.1-SNAPSHOT
$ ./gremlin.sh 

         \,,,/
         (o o)
-----oOOo-(_)-oOOo-----
gremlin>
```

bq. Unbeknownst to the Gods, there still lived one Titan. This Titan can not be seen, has no name, and is only apparent in the fact that reality exists. Upon the shoulders of this lost Titan, all of reality hangs together in an undulating web of relations.

h2. Connecting to Titan with Gremlin

[[https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/raw/master/doc/images/gremlin-running.png|width=125px|align=left|float]] 
"Gremlin":http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com is a graph traversal language that can be used with any "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com enabled graph database. With Gremlin, it is possible to both read and write to the graph. For a more in-depth review of Gremlin and Titan, please see the respective [[Gremlin Graph Traversals]] section of this documentation. For now, some simple Gremlin examples are provided to demonstrate how to interact with Titan via a "REPL":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop (i.e. an interactive shell). All the examples are with respect to the _Graph of the Gods_ diagrammed above and using Titan in embedded mode.

```

bq. "Hercules":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules, son of Jupiter and "Alcmene":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcmene, bore super human strength. Hercules was a "demigod":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demigod because his father was a god and his mother was a human. In a fit of madness caused by the jealous goddess "Juno":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(mythology), Hercules killed his wife and children. To atone for the slaying, Hercules was ordered by the "Oracle of Delphi":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_at_Delphi to serve "Eurystheus":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurystheus. Eurystheus appointed Hercules to 12 labors.
