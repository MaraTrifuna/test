In the beginning, there existed two deities known as Uranus and Gaia. They gave birth to Saturn, god of time, who set the heavens in motion. The existence of time gave life to the air, the sea, and to the end of things---death. To rule these notions, Saturn had three sons: Jupiter (air), Neptune (sea), and Pluto (death).
