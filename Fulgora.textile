h5. This is the documentation for Titan 0.4. <br> Documentation for the latest Titan version is available at "http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/current":http://s3.thinkaurelius.com/docs/titan/current.

Fulgora is a set of extensions to Titan with the purpose of making Titan capable of in-memory data processing for low latency query answering of both OLTP (real-time) and OLAP (batch) queries.

To make integration with Titan seamless, Fulgora is not a separate project or release but part of the Titan project. Fulgora encompasses a number of features and modules inside Titan geared toward optimized in-memory processing.

Fulgora is currently comprised of:

# The [[Hazelcast|Using Hazelcast]] distributed in-memory storage backend optimized for read-mostly graphs.
# _Rolling transactions_ with internal priority caches which provide support for long running transactions with smart memory management.

Note, that Fulgora is a new extension of Titan (introduced with Titan 0.4.0) and hence considered experimental. Additional Fulgora extensions will be rolled out with future versions of Titan.
