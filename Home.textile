Any storage system can be tailored to work with Titan, however, "Cassandra":http://cassandra.apache.org/ and "HBase":http://hbase.apache.org/ connectors are provided. Finally, Titan is a native "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com enabled graph database and as such, it supports the full "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com stack of technologies.
