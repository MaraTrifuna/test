Titan is a distributed "graph database":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database optimized for representing and processing massive-scale graphs over a cluster of machines. Various distributed persistence engines can be tailored to work with Titan, however, "Cassandra":http://cassandra.apache.org/ and "HBase":http://hbase.apache.org/ connectors are natively supported. Finally, Titan is a native "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com-enabled graph database and as such, supports the full "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com stack of technologies.
