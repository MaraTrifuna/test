Titan is a distributed "graph database":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database optimized for storing and querying "graphs":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics) represented over a cluster of machines. The cluster can elastically scale to support a growing dataset and user base. Titan has a pluggable storage architecture which allows it to build on proven database technology such as "Apache Cassandra":http://cassandra.apache.org/, "Apache HBase":http://hbase.apache.org/, or "Oracle BerkeleyDB":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/. Furthermore, the pluggable indexing architecture supports "ElasticSearch":http://elasticsearch.com/ and "Lucene":http://lucene.apache.org/. Titan supports global graph analytics, reporting and ETL through integration with "Apache Hadoop":http://hadoop.apache.org/. Titan is a native "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com enabled graph database and as such, it supports the full "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com stack of technologies.
