Titan is a distributed "graph database":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database optimized for processing large-scale "graphs":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics) represented over a cluster of machines. The pluggable storage architecture allows for any database to be configured to work with Titan. However, this distribution provides connectivity to both "Cassandra":http://cassandra.apache.org/ and "HBase":http://hbase.apache.org/. Titan is a native "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com enabled graph database and as such, it supports the full "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com stack of technologies.
