Titan is a distributed "graph database":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database optimized for processing massive-scale "graphs":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics) represented over a cluster of machines and can scale elastically as your data or user base grow. Titan is a native "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com enabled graph database and as such, it supports the full "TinkerPop":http://tinkerpop.com stack of technologies. Titan has a pluggable storage architecture which allows it to build on proven database technology such as "Apache Cassandra":http://cassandra.apache.org/, "Apache HBase":http://hbase.apache.org/, or "Oracle BerkeleyDB":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index-093405.html and makes integration into  existing database environments seamless.

h2. Titan Beginner's Guide

If you are new to Titan, the following pages will get you started quickly. If you are new to graph databases in general, we recommend you read a "brief primer on graph databases":http://markorodriguez.com/2011/04/30/putting-and-getting-data-from-a-database/.

* [[Getting Started]]: A simple step-by-step guide to setting up and using Titan
* [[The Benefits of Titan]]: Why you should consider using the Titan graph database
* [[Depending on Titan]]: How to use Titan in your projects

For more introductory information, watch the "Big Graph Data with Titan":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkAYA4Kd8JE&feature=youtu.be video or read the comprehensive "Titan: The Rise of Big Graph Data":http://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/titan-the-rise-of-big-graph-data presentation.
