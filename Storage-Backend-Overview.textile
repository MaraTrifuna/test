Titan persists all data in a storage backend. It supports various storage backends which is denoted by the @storage.backend@ option. The choice of backend determines the transactional guarantees and scalability of a particular Titan graph instance. This means, Titan can accomodate any level of isolation, consistency, scalability, or availability that a particular application may require.

However, the "CAP theorem":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem stipulates that any practical database can only provide 2 of the 3 desirable properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partitionability (i.e. scalability). The choice of storage backend is therefore a tradeoff guided by the requirements of a particular use case.

Titan currently supports 3 storage backends covering all 3 edges of the CAP theorem triangle as shown in the figure below.
